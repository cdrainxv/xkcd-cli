# xkcd-cli

---

## Basis:

This is a simple terminal based xkcd comic viewer based on my blog post: [Create A CLI App](https://cdrainxv.github.io/blog/cli/2017/11/18/creating-a-cli-app.html). The motivation was because of my love for the site, [xkcd](https://xkcd.com), and the various Node CLI packages I've been
using recently. I wanted to create my own simple one and this is the outcome:

##  Usage

```
